# Battle Lab Onboarding Guide
Welcome to the lab!

### Getting a computing cluster account

To get an account with RockFish, fill out an account request form on their [site](https://coldfront.rockfish.jhu.edu/), and wait for PI approval.

We also recommend reviewing the [marcc_guide](marcc_guide) (we used to use a cluster called MARCC).

### Using Slack
If you're new to Slack, you should download the app on your phone and desktop.  Once you're added to the JHU Genomics Collective Slack group, here's a few public channels to join:  
- `#general` and `#random` (automatically added)  
- `#joint_group_meeting`  
- `#jhu_papers`  
- `#papers`  
- `#ccb`  
- `#ccb_students`  

The lab uses Slack for most quick communication, so don't hesitate to direct message anyone in the lab with a question.  For starters, ask someone (my username is jpopp) to add you to the private lab channels:  
- `#battle_lab_misc` - the lab's general channel   
- `#battle_lab_trainee` - often used for MARCC questions  
- `#battle_journal_club` - the lab has a journal club that usually runs the weeks we don't have joint group meeting  
- `#battle_lab_random` - the lab's social channel    

### Get familiar with the research
The [lab website](https://battlelab.jhu.edu/) has a *Publications* section that you can check out for a full list of the lab's previous work.  For a longer list of recommended papers in each of the lab's areas of interest, check out [this compiled list of relevant papers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mLs9rMtLIp2Xu4z7ChIIcp838jDdPdoYkHoynu_2NBY/edit).
